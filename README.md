# Projects-documenter

### Introduction 
Project documenter is a simple UI i made to automate documenting projects i did during my undergrad years.
As i kept losing some of the projects i did in the semester, having no time to make a repo for them, and realizing the importance of them fr making my resume later, a made this small UI for documenting my project, with a header and a readme file of the discription, all compressed together for later.
### How to use
Simply download the zip file projects Documenter.zip, unzipp it, then you can run through the exe file PD.exe, you can then add a title, a description, then choose the directories to the files of the projec, then press Save Project. you projects will be saved in the Projects folder.
### modification
I provided the source code in this repo, feel free to modify it the way you like, then you can rebuild it using the command "python build.py build" . then add a folder with the name Projects to save your projects on it.
